A standard DFS implementation puts each vertex of the graph into one of two categories:

1.Visited
2.Not Visited

The purpose of the algorithm is to mark each vertex as visited while avoiding cycles.

The DFS algorithm works as follows:

1.Start by putting any one of the graph's vertices on top of a stack.
2.Take the top item of the stack and add it to the visited list.
3.Create a list of that vertex's adjacent nodes. Add the ones which aren't in the visited list to the top of the stack.
4.Keep repeating steps 2 and 3 until the stack is empty.

The time complexity of the DFS algorithm is represented in the form of O(V + E), where V is the number of nodes and E is the number of edges.

The space complexity of the algorithm is O(V).
